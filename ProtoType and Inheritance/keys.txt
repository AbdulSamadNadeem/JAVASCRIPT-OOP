What is DRY Principle??
The DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) principle is a software development
concept aimed at reducing redundancy in code. It emphasizes that information
or logic should be defined only once within a system, rather than being duplicated
in multiple places. The main idea is to keep code modular, efficient, and easier to maintain.
